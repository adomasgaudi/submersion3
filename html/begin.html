                        <h1 id="h1" style ="" >  Everything you need to know</h1>

                        <p  name="re mul main ta" state="new" > <span >  On this page you will find everything you need to successfully learn a new language. To begin, lets differentiate between Quality of attention and Quantity of attention. Let me explain.  </span> </p>

                       
                        <p  name="re mul main tc" state="new"> <span>Learning a language is a discipline with no bounds, relating to almost everything in life and hense could be investigated to infinity. All of the topics that need to be covered, discussed or understood are often end up being presented without distinction at the same time. They are interrelated to each other and so of course they need to be mentioned regardless of the categorisation. This convoluded research might lead one to search for answers to language acquisition only having to end up with the conclution that he/she is not having enough sleep, and suggestions to read a few books on how to improve sleep quality... Though inevitably pertinent to language learning it's not necessarily something that I want to have in my main language study chapter. What i'd like to do instead is to perhaps mention the importance of indirectly important topics but leave their extensive explanations in some other location, not interfering with my original query into directly related topics. </span> </p>
                        <p name="re mul main td" state="new" > <span ></span> Thus I would like to separate the two major groups of language learning topics, those being everything directly relating to leanguage learning and those being useful for many purposes including language learning.</p>


                        <h1>General theory</h1>

                        <article>
                            <p>This page will be divided into two main groups:

                            </p>
                            <ol>
                                <li>1st - Amount of attention</li>
                                <li>2nd - usefulness of attention</li>
                            </ol>

                            <p>Learning a language encompasses a myriad of life choices and startegies and tools and everything is very interrelated and mixed and important and unimportant. So... </p>
                            <p>Like in any discipline, we could the discuss how to better learn languages and arrive at the conclusion that you're not eating enough healty fats and that you should quit partying, because it's interfering with your sleeping routine. </p>
    
                            <p>I don't want to ignore that part of learning as it is inseparably important, however, I do think it would be useful to separate it away from more specific suggestions and solutions. </p>
    
                            <p>The website will be divided into two main groups. The <strong>first</strong> being more broad, relating to anything in life that has influence on language learning. The <strong>second</strong> will focus on everything that is almost exclusively beneficial to language learning and not directly beneficial to any broad life areas. </p>
