                    This type of learner will be focused on input way more than the other groups. Specifically listening. Essentially, you have to learn to comprehend the entire language without a translation or a dictionary. 
                    You can only start to read once you've become semi-fluent in understanding basic language. And you have to become completely fluent before even considering reading extensively. 
                    Otherwise the reading will influence you pronunciation and use of words. 
                
                </p>
                <p>Thus you cannot read. You also cannot use translations to understand you target vocabulary. In order to mimic a native child completely, it would be best to avoid complex vocabulary for a long time. Thus any word or grammar point that you cannot understand will have to wait. To acquire vocabulary in the most natural way, you would have to only understand words that are very clear and only after those words, to build a secondary vocabulary of more advance words.  </p>
