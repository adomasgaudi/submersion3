                The business man and the native are the two most common groups. Striving for relative proficiency in the language but within reasonable bounds. 

            </p>

            <p>
                The business man approach is the lower level, probably to around 5-8 thousand words (B2 level).
                At this level, most people will be largely ignorant of their grammar mistakes and will not be able to perceive any accent error above their level.                 
            </p>
            <p>It is important to distinguish the Immigrant at a b2 level from a businessman at a b2 level, as an immigrant will be able to perceive grammar mistakes and will be much better at recognising accent errors, though still not able to speak as well or have a large vocabulary. 
                The business man at a B2 level is at his peak. An will not desire higher proficiency.
