                <h2>Depending on the stage of the learning process the model changes slightly.</h2>
                <p>here are the stages</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>STAGE 1  ----  0 - 500  ----  "Deconstruction" </li>
                    <li>STAGE 2  ----  500 - 2000  ----  "To survival" </li>
                    <li>STAGE 3  ----  2000 - 4000  ----  "To functionality" </li>
                    <li>STAGE 4  ----  4000 - 8000  ----  "To fluency" </li>
                    <li>STAGE 5  ----  8000+  ----  " Beyond" </li>
                </ol>
                <p>I will not discuss STAGE 4 or 5 in this page</p>

                <p>Language ability, whether it be recognition or production, is recognised by most based on these criteria: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>inter-topic vocabulary not topic vocabulary</li>
                    <li>language accuracy not percision</li>
                    <li>High speed </li>
                </ol>
                <p>For all of these we will need natural immersion and procedural knowledge, not deep explicit knowledge and artificial vocab </p>
                <p>Natural immersion is pretty self-explanatory. How do we get procedural knowledge.</p>
                <p>Procedural knowledge is acquired not learned, unconsciously, through comprehensible input, messeges we understand. So What we need is as many comprehensible sentences as we can get. </p>
                <p>To do that we will need to improve our understanding of senteces and we can do that by using a myriad of tool, the major ones being: pop-ip dictionary, context and our memory</p>

<!-- 

                <p>To begin with we'll start with the "Deconstruction" Stage </p>
                <p>The main goals of this stage are the same. However, since sheer frequency of the words that we are listening is so high, that mere few hours a week litteraly gives us the equivalent exposure to words as though we were studying the language for 15h/ day. </p>
                <p>In that kind of frequency study, natural immersion is more than enough for your brain to be able to pick up everything that it needs</p>
                <p>That is true, however, not so much for the grammar and sentences, because even though words repeat frequently, the phrases and sentences don't. In fact, phrases repeat so infrequently that it is practically impossible to get any sentences into procedural memory. </p> -->
