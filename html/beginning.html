                <h1>General theory</h1>
                <h3>Important distinction</h3>
                <p>This page will be divided into two main groups:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>1st - Amount of attention</li>
                    <li>2nd - usefulness of attention</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Learning a language encompasses a myriad of life choices and startegies and tools and everything is very interrelated and mixed and important and unimportant. So... </p>

                <p>Like in any discipline, we could the discuss how to better learn languages and arrive at the conclusion that you're not eating enough healty fats and that you should quit partying, because it's interfering with your sleeping routine. </p>

                <p>I don't want to ignore that part of learning as it is inseparably important, however, I do think it would be useful to separate it away from more specific suggestions and solutions.  </p>

                <p>The website will be divided into two main groups. The <strong>first</strong> being more broad, relating to anything in life that has influence on language learning. The <strong>second</strong> will focus on everything that is almost exclusively beneficial to language learning and not directly beneficial to any broad life areas. </p>

                <h3>Descriptions</h3>
                <p>The 1st group is concerned with everything relating to motivation, philosophy, habits and all life choices that determine how how much time you will spend with the language and how focused, interested, motivated you will be. </p>
                <p>the second group will focus on What to do during those times when you've already decided to dedicate you time to language learning and then here we'll discuss how to best dedicate that time and what tools to use. </p>
