            <p class="expTop" >A lot of things could influence you language learning. However, I don't want to bother people with life philosophy advice if that's not what they're looking for. So to keep it organised, I've separated the material into two groups. </p>
            <article class="expBox" >
                <p> There are a lot of things that interest me that are related to language learning. For example, productivity, neuroscience, creative writing, philosphy, ect.... Though I think I'll indulge myself here and there with some off-topic posts I would still like to make a distinction between topics that are more directly related to language and less directly related.</p>
                <p>"More directly related" does not necessarily mean "making a greater impact". It simply means that it is more obviously related, not more strongly. For example, if you have some urgent job-related issues that are just burning like a house fire, I'm sure that it would probably be more beneficial for you to deal with those problems and then think about language learning. Equally, something like your sleep, nutrition, motivation, habits, your reasons for studying and your life phisolophy, all of those things could be much more influencial than, say, something as directly related as a specific exercise, but nonetheless, I would like to separate them into a different category</p>
            </article>
            <p>Everything relating to life choices that end up giving us more time with our target language or making us better learners or making us more interested or focused, those things will be under the "life" category</p>

            <p>Another way of looking at this is that, everything that lead up to you spending more time with your target language, is less directly related, while everything that you do once you're already during your dedicated language learning time is more directly related. You could think of it as trying to abtain time that will give you quantity of attention, and then once you have quantity, then what you decide to do with it determines the quality of that attention. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Quantity of Attention = Time dedicated</li>
                <li>Quality of Attention = Efficiency / Strategy</li>
            </ul>

            <!-- <p>Learning a language encompasses a myriad of life choices and startegies and tools and everything is very interrelated and mixed and important and unimportant. So... </p>
            <p>Like in any discipline, we could the discuss how to better learn languages and arrive at the conclusion that you're not eating enough healty fats and that you should quit partying, because it's interfering with your sleeping routine. </p>

            <p>I don't want to ignore that part of learning as it is inseparably important, however, I do think it would be useful to separate it away from more specific suggestions and solutions. </p>

            <p>The website will be divided into two main groups. The <strong>first</strong> being more broad, relating to anything in life that has influence on language learning. The <strong>second</strong> will focus on everything that is almost exclusively beneficial to language learning and not directly beneficial to any broad life areas. </p>
            
            <p>the second group will focus on What to do during those times when you've already decided to dedicate you time to language learning and then here we'll discuss how to best dedicate that time and what tools to use. </p> -->
