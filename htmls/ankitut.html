      <h4>The path a word takes from source to the depths of your brain.</h4>
      <ol>
        <li> 
          <h5>Look up  </h5>
          <p>This is the part were you've found a word that you don't know and you first want to see what it means.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5>save</h5>
          <p>Afterwards you want to save the word to a place where you can further edit it. This is important as it allows you to continue the next steps later, not immidiately after finding the word.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5>import</h5>
          <p>Next you want to take some of the words that you saved and import them into anki</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5>fix</h5>
          <p>After you've added the words, and decided to study them, only then fix them. They might contain unnesecary parts, so we can delete that.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5>add info</h5>
          <p>After deleting extraneous info we might want to add info</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
          <h5>study / familiarise</h5>
          <p>The last 2 steps were part of studying / familiarisation, but if needed you can further study the vocab in the list</p>
        </li>
        <hr/>
        <h4>From here on out you start the memorisation</h4>
        <li> 
          <h5>0 - 8mins</h5>
          <p>In this phase you can either read additional sentences and definitions or just try to memorise</p>
        </li>
        <h4>pssst. btw</h4>
        <p>if you know memory techniques you can actually bypass 0 - 8 and 8 - 1day immediately, though you won't have a good understanding of usage.</p>
        <li> 
          <h5>8 - 1day</h5>
          <p>In this phase you review the word after 8 and 30 mins (my interval settings) and </p>
        </li>
        <li>lvl ups</li>
        <li>1day - mature</li>
        <li>mature review</li>
