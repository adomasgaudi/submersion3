                            <p>Language proficiency has many aspects to it, to make the categories of these aspects more clear I will take a look at it from a more of a neurological perspective. I will separate language learning into parts that corelate to the path that information takes through the different parts in your brain.</p>

                            <p>Those main parts are <span class="popupTop">recognition</span>, knowledge and production.</p>
                                <p class="popupBot">This one is a common fluency illusion problem as people think that they can produce whatever they can understand</p>
                            <p class="expTop">Recognition meaning not understanding but the simple function of seeing or hearing language and being able to parse the sounds or letters. Whether you understand the meaning of the content is irrelevant at this point.</p>

                                            <p>
                                            An interesting science regarding this specific point is about infant fluidity when it comes to acquiring the ability to recognise sounds... </p>
                                        </article>
                            <p>After your brain has figured out which sounds do the scribbles on the page corelate to, then the next task is to associate combinations of those sounds into <span class="popupTop" >concepts</span> that you <span class="popupTop2">already have in your brain</span>. Once you have the concepts then you can think about the meaning and related stuff. Btw, could be doing that thinking in your target language, native language or even in no language at all also known as mentalese</p> 
                                        <p class="popupBot" >I think its important to note that these concepts can be very simple or could be very complex and they could be</p>   
                                        <p class="popupBot2" >Colloquially known as mentalese.</p>   
                            <p> The last step is to take those concepts and <span class="popupTop">produce</span> them into sounds. </p>
                                        <p class="popupBot" >An interesting example of explicit and procedural memory could maybe be more vividly illustrated in the case of deaf people. The gestures that deaf people have to make could be explained explicitly, but its much easier to see how hand gestures could be automatic meaning procedural. Its sort of like learning to ride a bike or skating. ...</p> 
                            <p> On top of this we have to make one more classification of explicit and procedural memory. Explicit memory is that knowledge of concepts that we can consciously think of, analyse, manipulate. Procedural memory is just what is sounds like. It makes procedures automatic. I takes, say, 5 actions and strings them together into an automatic chain that propagates without you having to think about it. </p>
                            
                            
                            <p class="expTop" >If you check yourself on vocab.com you will find out your passive vocabulary size that you can recognize explicitly. 
                            If you divide that number by 2 that will likely be your active vocabulary, meaning words that you can produce. 
                            I think that your procedural vocabulary is likely even smaller. However its that procedural vocabulary attained through input is what we want. </p>
                            <div class="expBox">
                                <p>Because that means, it is going to be correct and we'll be able to produce it without thinking. After all procedural processes are subconscious, so you'll literaly won't have to think to produce a sentence (to some degree). We also want a large explicit recognition vocabulary, as it is still way faster than looking up words in a dictionary and it leads to procedural memory.
