  <h3>Don't analyse too much</h3>
  <p>1. You'll burn out and the immersion will <strong>subconsciously</strong></p>become a chore
  <p>don't translate a show that you can't translate all the way. Once you get tired you won't be able to enjoy the show because you've put the effort so far to understand it, and now not understanding it would be a waste.</p>

  <h3>Think as an essentialist</h3>
  <p>doing all of the things that will help you learn the language as well as managing your daily tasks can quickly get overwhelming. </p>
  <p>The famous pareto principle states that 80% of your results will be brought by only 20% of your actions. </p>
  <p>Realise that the majority of your actions could be replaced by some other, better actions and choose to instead of doing them to spend time thinking about which action might be the best and which activities are clearly low return activities. </p>
  <p>I'm not talking about low return language learning activities only, but more about life activities in general.</p>
  <p>for example. Whatching some random youtube video from a channel you've seen a million times is a rather low return activity. If you decide that it is not actually a good task, nor in helping you career, nor fulfiling your life interests, nor helping you relax, then you may choose to replace that activity with a equally useless show, but in a target langugage. In that case you essentially replaced a low importance activity that you are addicted to with an activity of higher importance.</p>

  <h3>The world has changed don't think that you have too.</h3>
  <p>Information, opinions, messages, all of these things have greatly increased in the information age. Its statistically improbable to assume that you have adjusted your habits to match the required prioritisation that increasing information deserves. </p>
  <p>Don't assume you're the exeption, assume you're the rule and work from there. Your free to hope that you're the exeption, but don't assume you are.</p>
